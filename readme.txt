== Description ==

This plugin was inspired by [Medium](https://medium.com), it makes images load better on page paint. Providing a 'blurred' version of the image at the correct scale, then fading the true image in once loaded.
It works by default on all post featured images leveraging the Wordpress post_thumbnail_html filter.

For inline images the plugin searches through your post content and refactors the image for better loading.

NOTE:
You may need to regenerate thumbnails to create the blurred image for each attachment image. We recommend using the [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin.
